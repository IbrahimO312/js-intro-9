    TASK 1
Requirement:
Convert given Strings below to number data types and 
find their sum, product, division, subtraction, remainder 
and exponentiation.
let str1 = "5", str2 = "2";
Expected results:
The sum of 5 and 2 is = 7
The product of 5 and 2 is = 10
The division of 5 and 2 is = 2.5
The subtraction of  5 and 2 is = 3
The remainder of 5 and 2 is = 1
The exponentiation of 5 and 2 is = 25

console.log(`The remainder of ${str1} and ${str2} is = ${str1 % str2}`);
console.log(`The exponentiation of ${str1} and ${str2} is = ${str1 ** str2}`);
